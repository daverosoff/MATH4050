                <p>
                    By <xref ref="thm-archimedean-prop-reals"/>, there exists
                    <m>a \in \Z</m> such that <m>a \gt x</m>. Therefore, the
                    set
                    <me>
                        A = \{ a \in \Z : a \gt x \}
                    </me>
                    is nonempty. We observe that, by the 
                    well-ordering principle (<xref ref="thm-well-ordering"/>)
                    this set has a smallest element. (Strictly speaking, the
                    well-ordering principle doesn't apply to the set <m>A</m>,
                    but we can easily prove by contradiction that <m>A</m> has
                    a least element using the well-ordering principle.) Call
                    this smallest element <m>a_0</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let <m>N = a_0 - 1</m>. Then <m>x \lt a_0 = N + 1</m>,
                    because <m>a_0 \in A</m>. We also have <m>x \geq N</m>
                    because if not, then <m>N \gt x</m>, which means 
                    <m>N \in A</m>, which would contradict the minimality of
                    <m>a_0</m>. This shows that <m>N \leq x \lt N + 1</m>.

                <p>
                    For any real numbers <m>x \lt y</m>, there is a rational
                    number <m>r</m> with <m>x \lt r \lt y</m>.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    Choose <m>n \in \N</m> so that <m>n \gt \frac{1}{y-x}</m>.
                    This is possible by the Archimedean property of the real
                    numbers (<xref ref="thm-archimedean-prop-reals"/>). Then
                    <me>
                        \frac{1}{n} \lt y - x.
                    </me>
                    By the corollary above (<xref ref="cor-rats-between-nats"/>),
                    there is an integer <m>m</m> such that
                    <me>
                        m - 1 \leq nx \lt m.
                    </me>
                    Dividing this inequality by <m>n</m> gives
                    <me>
                        \frac{m-1}{n} \leq x \lt \frac{m}{n}.
                    </me>
                    Since <m>\frac{1}{n} \lt y - x</m>, we have
                    <me>
                        x + \frac{1}{n} \lt y,
                    </me>
                    and hence
                    <me>
                        \frac{m}{n} \lt x + \frac{1}{n} \lt y.
                    </me>
                    Thus <m>r = \frac{m}{n}</m> is a rational number such that
                    <m>x \lt r \lt y</m>.

                    <m>M</m> exists, we say that <m>A</m> is

            <p>
                Let <m>A = [0, 1]</m>. Then <m>1</m> is an upper bound for
                <m>A</m>, and in fact any real number <m>M \geq 1</m> is an

            <p>
                However, <m>M = \frac{1}{2}</m> is not an upper bound for

                    be a bijection. Choose <m>x \in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n</m>
                    and set <m>n_x = \min \{ k \in \N : x \in A_k \}</m>. Now

                        f \colon \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n \to \N \times \N

                        f(x) = 2^{n_x} 3^{f_{n_x}(x)}
                    </me>. Let us show that <m>f</m> is injective. So suppose that
                    <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> for some <m>x, y \in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n</m>.
                    Then

                    <me>
                        2^{n_x} 3^{f_{n_x}(x)} = 2^{n_y} 3^{f_{n_y}(y)}.
                    </me>
                    Using the unique factorization of positive integers into
                    primes, we have <m>n_x = n_y</m> and <m>f_{n_x}(x) = f_{n_y}(y)</m>,
                    and <m>f_{n_x}(x) = f_{n_x}(y)</m>. 
                    But <m>f_{n_x}</m> is injective.
                    Thus <m>x = y</m> and <m>f</m> is injective.

                The set <m>\Q</m> of rational numbers is countable. To see this,
                fix <m>m \in \N</m> and define
                <me>
                    A_m = \left\{ \frac{n}{m} : n \in \N \right\} \subseteq \Q
                </me>.
                Then <m>A_m</m> is countable because the function
                <me>
                    f \colon \N \to A_m, \quad f(n) = \frac{n}{m}
                </me>
                is a bijection. Now, define <m>-A_m</m> as
                <me>
                    -A_m = \left\{ -\frac{n}{m} : n \in \N \right\} \subseteq \Q
                </me>.
                Then <m>-A_m</m> is also countable, by a similar argument.
                Now, observe that
                <me>
                    \Q = \{0\} \cup \bigcup_{m=1}^\infty (A_m \cup -A_m).
                </me>
                Since <m>\{0\}</m> is finite and each <m>A_m</m> and <m>-A_m</m> is countable,
                it follows from
                <xref ref="thm-countable-properties"/> that <m>\Q</m> is countable.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>f \colon \N \to \R</m> is a function.
                    We will show that <m>f</m> is not surjective, and hence
                    that <m>\R</m> is uncountable. For each <m>n \in \N</m>,
                    let <m>I_n = [a_n, b_n]</m> be a closed interval such that
                    <m>I_{n+1} \subset I_n</m> and

                        I_n \cap f(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}) = \varnothing
                    </me>.
                    We sketch briefly why it is possible to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Start with <m>I_1 = [a_1, b_1]</m>. Choose <m>a_1</m>
                    and <m>b_1</m> so that <m>a_1 \lt b_1</m> and
                    <m>f(1) \notin I_1</m>. Now suppose that
                    <m>I_n = [a_n, b_n]</m> has been chosen so that
                    <m>I_n \cap f(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}) = \varnothing</m>.
                    To choose <m>I_{n+1} = [a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}]</m>,
                    first choose <m>a_{n+1}</m> and <m>b_{n+1}</m> so that
                    <m>a_{n+1} \lt b_{n+1}</m> and <m>f(n+1) \notin I_{n+1}</m>. 
                    Then set <m>a_{n+1} = \max(a_n, a_{n+1})</m> and
                    <m>b_{n+1} = \min(b_n, b_{n+1})</m>. This ensures that
                    <m>I_{n+1} \subset I_n</m> and
                    <m>I_{n+1} \cap f(\{1, 2, \ldots, n+1\}) = \varnothing</m>.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Now, by the nested interval property
                    (<xref ref="thm-nested-interval-property"/>),
                    there is a point <m>x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n</m>.
                    That is, <m>x \in I_n</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is enough to show that <m>f</m> is not surjective.
                    For if <m>x = f(n)</m> for some <m>n \in \N</m>, then
                    <m>x \in f(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\})</m>. But
                    <m>x \in I_n</m> and <m>I_n \cap f(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\})
                    = \varnothing</m>, so this is impossible.
                    Thus <m>x \ne f(n)</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since <m>f</m> is not surjective, <m>x \notin f(\N)</m>.
                    Thus <m>x</m> is an element of <m>\R</m> that is not in the image of <m>f</m>,
                    proving that <m>f</m> is not surjective.

                    Suppose there is a bijection <m>f \colon A \to 2^A</m>.

                    Since <m>B \subseteq A</m>, we have <m>B \in 2^A</m>.
                    Since <m>f</m> is surjective, there is <m>y \in A</m>

            <p>
                Indeed, let's define for each <m>f \in A</m> a set

                Now define a function <m>F \colon \N \to 2^{\N}</m> by

                In particular, this holds for <m>n = 2N</m> and <m>n = 2N + 1</m>.
                Thus

                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>(a_n)</m> is a sequence that converges to
                    <m>a \in \R</m>. Let <m>\eps = 1</m>. Then there is
                    <m>N \in \N</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N</m>,
                    <me>
                        \abs{a_n - a} \lt 1.

                    </me>,
                    for all <m>n \geq N</m>. Now, let

                        M = \max(\abs{a_1}, \abs{a_2}, \ldots, \abs{a_{N-1}}, 1 + \abs{a}).
                    </me>
                    Then <m>M \geq 0</m> and <m>\abs{a_n} \leq M</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
                    This shows that <m>(a_n)</m> is bounded.

        </proposition>
        <example>
            <p>
                The sequence <m>((-1)^n)</m> is bounded, since
                <m>\abs{(-1)^n} = 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
                However, as we saw earlier, this sequence diverges.

        <example>
            <p>
                The sequence <m>\left(\frac{n^2}{n-1}\right)</m> diverges.
                To see this, observe that
                <me>
                    \frac{n^2}{n-1} \gt \frac{n^2}{n} = n
                </me>.
                If the sequence were bounded, then there would be
                <m>M \geq 0</m> such that <m>\frac{n^2}{n-1} \leq M</m> for all
                <m>n \in \N</m>. This would imply that <m>n \leq M</m> for all

                    <me>
                        a_n \leq c_n \leq b_n
                    </me>
                    for all <m>n \in \N</m>. If <m>(a_n)</m> and <m>(b_n)</m> converge to the same limit
                    <m>L \in \R</m>, then <m>(c_n)</m> also converges to <m>L</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    Let <m>\eps \gt 0</m> be given. Since <m>(a_n)</m> converges to <m>L</m>,
                    there is <m>N_1 \in \N</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N_1</m>,
                    <me>
                        \abs{a_n - L} \lt \eps
                    </me>.
                    Since <m>(b_n)</m> converges to <m>L</m>,
                    there is <m>N_2 \in \N</m> such that for all <m>n \geq N_2</m>,
                    <me>
                        \abs{b_n - L} \lt \eps
                    </me>.
                    Now, let <m>N = \max(N_1, N_2)</m>. Then for all <m>n \geq N</m>,
                    <md>
                        <mrow>L - \eps \amp \lt a_n \leq c_n \leq b_n \lt L + \eps</mrow>
                        <mrow>\implies \amp \abs{c_n - L} \leq \max(\abs{a_n - L}, \abs{b_n - L}) \lt \eps</mrow>
                    </md>,
                    as required.
