                    For each <m>x \in \R</m> there is a unique <m>N \in \Z</m>

                <p>
                    By <xref ref="thm-archimedean-prop-reals"/>, there exists
                    <m>a \in \Z</m> such that <m>a \gt x</m>. Therefore, the
                    set
                    <me>
                        A = \{ a \in \Z : a \gt x \}
                    </me>
                    is nonempty. We observe that, by the 
                    well-ordering principle (<xref ref="thm-well-ordering"/>)
                    this set has a smallest element. (Strictly speaking, the
                    well-ordering principle doesn't apply to the set <m>A</m>,
                    but we can easily prove by contradiction that <m>A</m> has
                    a least element using the well-ordering principle.) Call
                    this smallest element <m>a_0</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let <m>N = a_0 - 1</m>. Then <m>x \lt a_0 = N + 1</m>,
                    because <m>a_0 \in A</m>. We also have <m>x \geq N</m>
                    because if not, then <m>N \gt x</m>, which means 
                    <m>N \in A</m>, which would contradict the minimality of
                    <m>a_0</m>. This shows that <m>N \leq x \lt N + 1</m>.

                <p>
                    For any real numbers <m>x \lt y</m>, there is a rational
                    number <m>r</m> with <m>x \lt r \lt y</m>.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    Choose <m>n \in \N</m> so that <m>n \gt \frac{1}{y-x}</m>.
                    This is possible by the Archimedean property of the real
                    numbers (<xref ref="thm-archimedean-prop-reals"/>). Then
                    <me>
                        \frac{1}{n} \lt y - x.
                    </me>
                    By the corollary above (<xref ref="cor-rats-between-nats"/>),
                    there is an integer <m>m</m> such that
                    <me>
                        m - 1 \leq nx \lt m.
                    </me>
                    Dividing this inequality by <m>n</m> gives
                    <me>
                        \frac{m-1}{n} \leq x \lt \frac{m}{n}.
                    </me>
                    Since <m>\frac{1}{n} \lt y - x</m>, we have
                    <me>
                        x + \frac{1}{n} \lt y,
                    </me>
                    and hence
                    <me>
                        \frac{m}{n} \lt x + \frac{1}{n} \lt y.
                    </me>
                    Thus <m>r = \frac{m}{n}</m> is a rational number such that
                    <m>x \lt r \lt y</m>.

                    Let <m>A \subseteq \R</m>. A real number <m>M</m> is an

                    every <m>a \in A</m>, <m>a \leq M</m>. If such an
                    <m>M</m> exists, we say that <m>A</m> is

            <p>
                Let <m>A = [0, 1]</m>. Then <m>1</m> is an upper bound for
                <m>A</m>, and in fact any real number <m>M \geq 1</m> is an

            <p>
                However, <m>M = \frac{1}{2}</m> is not an upper bound for

                number <m>N</m> such that <m>N \gt M</m>. Since
                <m>N \in \R</m>, this shows that <m>M</m> is not an upper bound for

                <p>
                    Let <m>A = \{ a_n : n \in \N \}</m>. We have <m>A \ne
                    \varnothing</m> and <m>A</m> is bounded above by
                    <m>b_1</m>, since <m>a_n \leq b_n \leq b_1</m> for all

                    <m>A</m> has a supremum; call it <m>x = \sup{(A)}</m>.
                    Now fix <m>m \in \N</m> and consider <m>I_m = [a_m, b_m]</m>.
                    Since <m>a_m \in A</m>, we have <m>a_m \leq x</m>. Also,
                    since <m>b_m</m> is an upper bound for <m>A</m>, we have
                    <m>x \leq b_m</m>. Thus <m>x \in I_m</m>. Since
                    <m>m</m> was arbitrary, we have <m>x \in I_n</m> for all
                    <m>n \in \N</m>, and hence
                    <me>
                        x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n
                    </me>.
                    This shows that <m>\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \ne \varnothing</m>,
                    as required.

                It is necessary that the intervals <m>I_n</m> be closed in order
                for the conclusion of the theorem to hold. For example, let
                <m>I_n = (0, \frac{1}{n})</m>. Then
                the intervals <m>I_n</m> are nested, but their intersection is empty:
                <me>
                    \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \varnothing
                </me>, by the archimedean property
